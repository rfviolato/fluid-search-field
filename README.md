# fluid-search-field
Github profiles search field with fluid spring animations.

[Check it out](https://fluid-search-field.vercel.app/)

## Motivation

I wanted to try out spring animations for the first time, so chose to build a search field with auto-suggestions and use [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to manage the micro-interactions animations.
